         <h2>Hi!</h2>
         <p>We here at the Cube Earth Society accept the fact that your entire life you belived in the lies your parents and teachers taught you about a shpere or flat Earth. We are willing to help you forget that past and help you build a better cube future. Becoming a Cube Earther has 6 times the benifits of becoming a Flat Earther!</p>
         <br><br>
         <h2>What about...</h2>
         <p>We know you have some doubts, but we're here to answer all your question. <br> Wondering why you've never seen the the edge or corner of the world? Well, those are mountians. The colder areas of the Earth are at the corners, furthest away from the Earth's core.</p>
